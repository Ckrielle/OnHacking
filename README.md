# OnHacking

This repository works as two sides of the same coin. 
* One, as a constant accumulator (and PoW) of my knowledge on Ethical Hacking
* Two, as a checklist to use on CTFs. A methodology manifesto so to say

It includes information about almost every CTF category. From Web and Crypto, to Hardware and OSINT. What many would describe as Jeopardy, or [AppSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXThugPk_zA). It includes information on boxes as well (though between us I prefer Jeopardy more ðŸ˜‰). It will be constantly updated.
