# OnHacking | Crypto

Crypto is considered one of the harder categories, obviously due to the math involved. Knowing math is require, just as knowing how the web works, or C and 
Assembly. While good google search queries can help people (and by people I mean everyone) deal with this category, it is also important to put in the effort 
(if it is a category you want to get into) to gain the mathematical knowledge needed to understand what is going on. We are going to split it into these areas:
* [Classic Cryptography](#classic-cryptography)
* [Modern Cryptographhy](#modern-cryptography)
* [Everything Else](#everything-else)

But first, some

## Python Basics


## Classic Cryptography
Classic Cryptography isn't used today, it's mostly kept for brain puzzles. You can easily find them in CTFs.


## Modern Cryptography



## Everything Else
What a name! The name is self explanatory. Here belongs everything that can be found in CTF Crypto challenges, like abusing pseudo-random generators, hashes,
XOR, etc..
